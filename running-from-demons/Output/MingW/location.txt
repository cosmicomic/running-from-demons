There are a few trees to the side, as well as a small patch of flowers.#Subway#Description#Road#Description#Hallway#Like the bedroom, the hallway has a faded carpet that might have been orange, purple, or green in its happier days. A flight of stairs leading downwards lies to the east. There is a window on the wall to the west. The walls are blank and grey. There are no doors except for the one from which you entered, which lies to the south behind you.#Lobby#The lobby is a squarish, decently spacious room with whitewashed walls and a grey carpet.
